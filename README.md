WPF Sprite Graphics Map Maker

A friend wanted a quick way to make some maps for D&D. I suggested sprite sheets and put this together to test with. 

Load a sprite graphics sheet (32x32 only for this first version) select a graphic from the pallete and click away whereever you want it to appear.

This will also work to make custom Sprite sheets, load one, add the tiles you want to the map section, load another and add more until you are happy with the selection and then you can use the Save To Image feature to create a PNG, which you could later load as a sheet to work from.
